                <p class="p">Goku is the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball series. He is a kind-hearted, fearless warrior known for his love of fighting strong opponents and constantly pushing his limits.
                    <br><br>

Originally born as Kakarot, a member of the alien Saiyan race, Goku was sent to Earth as a baby. A head injury altered his nature, turning him from a destructive warrior into a pure-hearted hero. Raised by Grandpa Gohan, he grows up to become Earth's strongest defender.
<br><br>
Goku is famous for his signature attacks like the Kamehameha, his ability to transform into powerful forms like Super Saiyan, and his endless determination to protect his friends and the planet—even if it means risking his life. His cheerful, naive personality and tireless spirit have made him one of the most iconic characters in anime history.

                <img src="img/vegeta.jpg" width="50%"></center>
                <p class="p">Vegeta is one of the most iconic characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the Prince of the Saiyan race, originally introduced as a ruthless villain, but later becomes one of the series' greatest heroes and Goku’s lifelong rival.
<br><br>
Vegeta is proud, fiercely competitive, and obsessed with becoming stronger—especially surpassing Goku. Despite his harsh and arrogant exterior, he has undergone tremendous character development, showing loyalty, love for his family (Bulma, Trunks, and later Bulla), and even sacrificing himself for the greater good.
<br><br>
Known for his powerful techniques like the Galick Gun and Final Flash, Vegeta is a tactical, relentless fighter. His journey from a merciless warrior to a proud protector of Earth makes him one of the most complex and admired characters in Dragon Ball.
