                <p class="p">One Piece is a long-running Japanese anime and manga series created by Eiichiro Oda. It follows the adventurous journey of Monkey D. Luffy, a cheerful and determined pirate with a rubber-like body, as he sails across the seas in search of the legendary treasure called One Piece to become the King of the Pirates.

Luffy forms a diverse crew called the Straw Hat Pirates, each with their own dreams and unique abilities. Together, they face powerful enemies, uncover world-shaking secrets, and explore strange islands in a vast, richly detailed world.

One Piece blends action, humor, emotional storytelling, and deep themes like freedom, friendship, and justice—making it one of the most beloved and successful anime series of all time.</p>

                <p class="p">Monkey D. Luffy is the main protagonist of One Piece, created by Eiichiro Oda. He’s a fearless, fun-loving pirate whose dream is to find the legendary treasure One Piece and become the King of the Pirates.
                    <br><br>

As a child, Luffy ate the Gum-Gum Fruit (Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gave his body rubber-like abilities—allowing him to stretch, bounce, and deliver powerful attacks like the Gum-Gum Pistol. Despite his goofy and carefree nature, Luffy has a strong sense of justice, unwavering loyalty to his friends, and an unbreakable will.
<br><br>

He is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, a diverse crew he gathers on his journey. Luffy’s strength, courage, and ability to inspire others have made him one of the most iconic and beloved characters in anime and manga history.</p>

                <p class="p">Roronoa Zoro is one of the main characters in One Piece and the first member to join Luffy’s crew, the Straw Hat Pirates. He’s a master swordsman known for his unique fighting style—Three-Sword Style (Santoryu)—where he wields a sword in each hand and one in his mouth.
<br><br>
Zoro is serious, disciplined, and incredibly loyal to Luffy, often acting as the crew’s second-in-command. His dream is to become the world’s greatest swordsman by defeating Dracule Mihawk, the current strongest.
<br><br>
Despite his terrible sense of direction and occasional comedic moments, Zoro is fiercely determined, willing to endure extreme pain and make huge sacrifices to protect his crew. His strength, resolve, and honor have made him a fan-favorite and one of the most respected warriors in the One Piece world.</p>
