                <p class="p">Uzumaki Naruto is the full name of the main protagonist of the Naruto series. He’s a spirited and resilient ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village who grows up as an outcast because he carries the fearsome Nine-Tailed Fox (Kurama) sealed inside him.
<br><br>
Despite loneliness and rejection, Naruto’s determination to prove himself and protect his friends drives his journey. He dreams of becoming Hokage, the strongest leader of his village, to gain recognition and bring peace.
<br><br>
Naruto is famous for his cheerful personality, strong will, and signature abilities like the Shadow Clone Jutsu and Rasengan. His story is one of growth, friendship, and never giving up—even against overwhelming odds—making him one of the most beloved characters in anime.</p>

                <img src="img/sasuke.jpg" width="50%"></center>
                <p class="p">Sasuke Uchiha is one of the main characters in the Naruto series and Naruto’s closest friend—and rival. He’s a member of the prestigious Uchiha clan, known for their powerful Sharingan eye technique.

Sasuke’s childhood is marked by tragedy: his older brother, Itachi, massacred their entire clan, leaving Sasuke driven by revenge. This dark mission leads him down a complex path—sometimes fighting alongside Naruto and their friends, other times going rogue to seek power at any cost.

He’s skilled, calm, and incredibly talented, mastering powerful jutsu like Chidori and evolving his Sharingan into the legendary Mangekyo Sharingan. Sasuke’s story is about struggle, redemption, and finding his true path beyond vengeance, making him one of the most compelling and conflicted characters in the series.</p>
